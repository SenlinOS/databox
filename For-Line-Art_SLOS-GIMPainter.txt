English:

For Line Art, you can use 006,007,008 and 009 brushes, and 006,007,008 is a Smooth-stroke by default. 009 There are no Smooth-stroke.
006-009 brush belongs to the Ink Tool. The effect of the original parameters of the Ink Tool: the size of the brush will become very large when pressed and held. The size of fast drawing lines will become very thin, which is not suitable for Line Art.
The reasonable parameters have been set in SLOS-GIMPainter, which is very suitable for using Graphics Tablet to control the thickness change of lines.
006-008 You can draw beautiful lines by painting at a constant speed, and you can draw beautiful lines by painting quickly. Note: When Smooth-stroke are turned on, there will be hysteresis when drawing too short lines.

Or use any brush in SLOS-GIMPainter to draw lines, because I have written the parameters of Smooth-stroke into each brush file.
Setting the two parameters of the Smooth-stroke to 100% is not the best effect. These two parameters should be used in conjunction with each other. The advantage of SLOS-GIMPainter project is that you don't need to study these parameters, just use these brushes to paint.

My SLOS-GIMPainter project is absolutely safe.
I'm not afraid of being checked when I put the code on GitHub :)

中文：

对于线艺术，可以使用006，007，008和009画笔，006，007，008默认是平滑线条。009没有平滑线条。
006-009画笔属于墨水工具，墨水工具原始参数的效果：在按住时画笔尺寸会变得很大。快速画线的尺寸会变得很细，这不适合做线条艺术。
SLOS-GIMPainter中已经设置了合理的参数，非常适合使用数位板控制线条的粗细变化。
006-008匀速的绘画就可以画出漂亮的线条，快速的绘画也可以画出漂亮的线条。注意：开启平滑线条时，画太短的线时会有滞后感。

或使用SLOS-GIMPainter中的任何一个画笔进行画线，因为我已经把平滑线条的参数写入每一个画笔文件中。
将平滑线的两个参数设置为100%不是最佳效果。这两个参数应该结合使用。SLOS-GIMPainter项目的好处就是你不需要去研究这些参数，只是使用这些画笔去绘画即可。

我的SLOS-GIMPainter项目绝对安全。
我把代码放到GitHub上就不怕被检查 :)
